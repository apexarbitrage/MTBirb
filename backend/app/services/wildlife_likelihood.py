"""Scores a trail's likelihood of a wildlife encounter from cached eBird sightings.

This is a first-pass proxy (raw nearby-observation counts), not a calibrated probability.
It does not yet account for search effort (checklists per area), seasonality, or time of
day, which is exactly the modeling work flagged as needing the most design time before this
becomes the "highest chance of seeing an owl" feature described in the product plan.
